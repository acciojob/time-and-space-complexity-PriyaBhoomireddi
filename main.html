	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a concept used to describe the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. It helps in analyzing how efficient an algorithm is, allowing us to predict its behavior as the input size grows.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion. It includes the space required for the input, as well as the auxiliary space used by the algorithm. Space Complexity is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input.</p>
